# Euclids-Algorithm-GCF-Calculator
This console application empowers users to find the GCF of any two integers while also discovering their common factors. It serves as an educational tool for understanding GCF calculations and factors.

## **Key Features**

- User-Friendly Interface: The program guides users to input two integers effortlessly.
- Mathematical Computation: It employs mathematical operations to determine the GCF and common factors of the provided integers.
- Vector Manipulation: Utilizing C++ vectors, the program efficiently stores and analyzes the common factors.
- Interactive: Users have the option to rerun the program, promoting iterative learning and exploration.

## **Implementing Euclid's Algorithm**
This program uses Euclid's algorithm to calculate the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) of the provided integers. Euclid's algorithm is a time-tested method for finding the GCF of two numbers by iteratively taking the remainder of the larger number divided by the smaller number until a remainder of zero is reached. The last non-zero remainder is the GCF.

## **How to Use**
1. Launch the program.
2. Input the first and second integers for GCF calculation.
3. Observe the GCF result and the common factors of the provided integers.
4. Choose whether to run the program again or exit.

## **Educational Purpose**
This program is an educational resource for students and enthusiasts who want to understand the concept of finding the Greatest Common Factor and exploring common factors in a practical and interactive manner.
